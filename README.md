# double_pendulum
To study the radial distribuiton of a double pendulum.\
In collaboration with Aarsh Amitbhai Chotalia (Aarshh)


To do:
* Distribution change with time
* Result change with running it twice
* Result change with different \delta t
* Then finally, different distributions as you get close

Three hypotheses:

* Same distribution for all initial condition - X
* Different distribution: for dZ -> 0, distribution comes closer
* Different distribution: for dZ -> 0, distribution are a lot different
